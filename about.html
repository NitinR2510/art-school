                <h2>Klara D.</h2>
                <p>
                    Klara is the inspiration for this hypothetical art school for children. As this website is being created Klara is 11 years old. 
                    Like any child, she has been making art since she was very young. It started with 'potato people' and over the years advanced 
                    to incredibly detailed Manga characters. Klara loves to create and build as well and to have a space where
                    children can explore their imagination in creative and artistic ways and learn at the same time, would be just wonderful.
                    At the moment Klara has no easy access to a place like that, but we can dream about the possibilities with this website.

                <h2>Susanne B.-R.</h2>
                <p>
                Susanne runs the crafts classes at Creative Spaces. She has been crafting and painting for more than 60 years!
                In recent years her passion has been working with paper and using it to make beautiful treasure boxes of all shapes, sizes,
                and colors. She also enjoys drawing and writing greeting cards, building with wood, and being inspired by her 7 grandchildren to 
                come up with ever new creations! Other than arting and crafting, Susanne enjoys music, reading, writing, sailing, traveling,
                and being a grandmother. She also teaches adults how to make her beautiful boxes and often visits small art fairs 
                with her creations. Here is a link to her website:

                <h2>Wiltrud D.</h2>
                <p>
                Wiltrud teaches the painting classes at Creative Spaces. She loves to paint with watercolors, acrylics, 
                oil pastels, soft pastels, and mixing all the media is a lot of fun too! When not crafting and painting, she
                loves to garden, write poetry, cook, and so much more; "there is so much to learn and try" she says, 
                boredom is a mystery to her. In 'real' life she lives in Woodford, Co. Galway, where she has lived for decades
                since emigrating to Ireland from Germany. She has exhibited her art at many locations in the area including 
                the Birr Theatre and Arts Centre, the 
                Cafe Winebar "The snug" in Mountshannon, the Woodford Heritage Centre, and more!
