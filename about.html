                Klara is the inspiration for this hypothetical art school for children. As this website is being created Klara is 11 years old. 
                Like any child, she has been making art since she was very young. It started with 'potato people' and over the years advanced 
                to incredibly detailed Manga characters and other subjects. Klara loves to create and build as well and to have a space where
                children can explore their imagination in creative and artistic ways and learn at the same time, would be just wonderful.
                At the moment Klara has no easy access to a place like that, but we can dream about the possibilities with this website.
